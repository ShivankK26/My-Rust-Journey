# Rust Learning Journey Repository

Welcome to my Rust Learning Journey repository! ðŸš€

This repository is designed to share my daily progress as I embark on a journey to learn Rust. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer exploring Rust for the first time, this repository is meant to be a beginner-friendly resource.

## How to Use This Repository

### Folder Structure

- Each day's code is organized into a dedicated folder (e.g., `Day_1`, `Day_2`, etc.).
- Inside each folder, you'll find the Rust source code files along with any additional resources or notes.

### Daily Progress

- **Day 1:** Introduction to Rust, installation, and basic syntax.
- **Day 2:** Exploring variables, data types, and basic control flow.
- **Day 3:** Functions, ownership, and borrowing.
- ...and so on.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/My-Rust-Journey.git
   cd Day_1
   ```

2. **Explore the Codebase:**
   Navigate to the `Day_1` directory (or the latest day) and explore the Rust code files. Each file contains comments and explanations to guide you through the learning process.

3. **Run the Code:**
   If applicable, try running the Rust code using the Cargo package manager for more complex projects.

4. **Contribute and Ask Questions:**
   Feel free to contribute by adding your own solutions or improvements. If you have questions or need clarification, open an issue. Let's learn together!
